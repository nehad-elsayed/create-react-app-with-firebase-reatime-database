snapshot : is a screenshot of the data which exist in realtime database

we use snapshot.exists to ensure that the snapshot is not empty

we  use the snapshot.val() => to get the values in the snapshot 



we use object.values here like this =>
   const snapshot = await get(dbRef);
    if (snapshot.exists) {
      setFruitsMenu(Object.values(snapshot.val()));
    }

    =>because the data comes as js object not array so we should convert it  to array 



The difference between js object and the array :

js object =>
{
"fruit1Id":{
    fruitName: "apple",
    fruitDefinition:" a red fruit"
}
"fruit2Id":{
    fruitName:"strawberry",
    fruitDefinition:"small and red"
}

}


but after we use object.values( ) the shape becomes without Id =>

[
    {fruitName:"apple",
    fruitDefinition:"a red fruit"},

    {fruitName:"strawberry",
    fruitDefinition:"small and red"}
]
